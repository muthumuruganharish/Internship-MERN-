# 🚀 Learning the MERN Stack

Hi! I'm Harish 👋  
I'm currently exploring the **MERN stack** to build full-stack web applications with a modern and powerful tech combo:

- 🟢 **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage
- 🟡 **Express.js** – Fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js
- 🔵 **React.js** – Component-based front-end library for building dynamic UIs
- ⚫ **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime that powers the backend

---

## 🌱 Why MERN?

The MERN stack allows me to build full-fledged applications using just **JavaScript** on both frontend and backend. It's a popular, production-ready stack used in real-world tech companies, and I’m excited to learn how the pieces fit together.

## 📚 What I'm Working On

- 🔍 Understanding REST APIs and how the backend communicates with the frontend
- 💡 Building small projects like a To-Do App, Blog platform, and a Notes app
- ⚙️ Setting up routing and state management in React
- 🌐 Connecting MongoDB databases to the backend using Mongoose

## 🛠 Technologies I'm Using

| Area          | Tech           |
|---------------|----------------|
| Frontend      | React.js, HTML,Java Script, CSS |
| Backend       | Node.js, Express.js |
| Database      | MongoDB        |
| Tools         | Git, GitHub, VS Code |

## 📈 What’s Next?

I'm working toward creating a fully-functional **CRUD application** that allows users to create, read, update, and delete data—using React on the frontend and Express + MongoDB on the backend.
